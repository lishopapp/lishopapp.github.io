<h3>About the project</h3>
<p>One day I needed to find a shopping list app for my iPhone. I searched the App Store and found many apps, but the truth is that no one liked me. Some were very complex, some were very expensive, others were very ugly.</p>
<p>So I decided to create my own application. I made simple quick and easy to use: just as I want. I uploaded it to the App Store just to learn how it was done. What happened then is that many people downloaded the first version and received very good reviews. These comments encouraged me so good
continue to create new versions.</p>
